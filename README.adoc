= Golang Gotchas

This project is intended to demonstrate rough edges that I discover in
the Go programming language, as I learn and use it.

== Usage

Even though there's source code here, and it's available under a free
software license, I wouldn't recommend using any of it -- it's
intentionally not good.

The "gotchas" are demonstrated through failing tests, which can be run
using the following command:

[source,shell]
----
go test ./...
----
